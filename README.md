# Simple-Calculator-Server-Client

This project is a simple calculator that can perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The project consists of two parts: a client and a server. The client is a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows the user to enter numbers and operators and see the result. The server is a program that receives the calculation request from the client, performs the calculation, and sends back the result. The client and the server communicate using socket programming.
